      A croissant is a laminated, yeast-leavened bakery product that contains
      dough rolled in fat layers to create a flaky, crispy texture. Croissants
      belong to the Viennoiserie or pastry category of baked goods along with
      brioche, Danish and puff pastries. A croissant usually contains normal
      levels of salt, yeast and sugar.
